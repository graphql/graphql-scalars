# GraphQL Custom Scalars Specification Contribution Guide

Thanks for contributing to GraphQL Scalars.

The goal of the GraphQL Scalars project is to provide a directory of GraphQL
Custom Scalar specifications, contributed by the community. Contributed
specifications are hosted on a GraphQL Foundation owned domain
[scalars.graphql.org](https://scalars.graphql.org), which can be referenced with
the built-in `@specifiedBy`
[GraphQL directive](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec--specifiedBy).

GraphQL Custom Scalar specifications are language agnostic and thus can be used
to document and standardize behavior across different languages.

Please ensure that you read the
[Code of Conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/) before contributing to
this project.

## How to contribute

1. Copy the `template-string.md`
   [template](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-scalars/blob/main/scalars/template-string.md)
   for Custom Scalars based on the built-in String Scalar, or otherwise use the
   `template.md`
   [template](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-scalars/blob/main/scalars/template.md)
   for all other Custom Scalars. Templates are located in the
   [graphql-scalars GitHub repository](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-scalars/tree/main/scalars).

2. Modify your selected template, and save it in the correct place
   `scalars/contributed/<github-user-name>/<scalar-name>.md` in the
   [graphql-scalars GitHub repository](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-scalars/tree/main/scalars/contributed).
   The directory location is important, as this will form part of the reference
   URL for your specification.

3. Install dependencies with `npm install` and the run `npm run build` to
   locally build the resulting public specification files. Navigate to the
   `/public` folder to view the built files.

4. Run `npm test` to ensure proper formatting before submitting a pull request.

5. [Open a new pull request](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-scalars/pulls)
   for each Custom Scalar specification you would like to add.

### Review process

Your specification pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer of the
[graphql-scalars repository](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-scalars). The
maintainers will verify that the template has been completed, but note that the
correctness of the specification is the responsibility of the original
contributor.

### Immutable specifications

Specification semantics must not change, as specifications are publicly
available reference documents. We will permit small edits which do not change
specification semantics, such as typo fixes.

A new version of a Custom Scalar specification should have a new scalar name,
either with a number appended such as `<scalar-name>2`, or a different name such
as `OffsetDateTime` to differentiate from `DateTime`.

## Licensing
