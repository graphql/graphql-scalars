# Overview

This scalar represents a date without a time-zone in the
[ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) calendar system.

The pattern is "YYYY-MM-DD" with "YYYY" representing the year, "MM" the month
and "DD" the day.

Valid examples are "1983-10-20" or "2023-04-01". An invalid example would be
"2011-13-10" because there isn't a 13th month in a year.

The prefix "Local" comes from the fact that without a time-zone it is not a
specific point in time, but rather expresses a "local point of view". A popular
use case for using this scalar are birthdays for example, which are normally not
stored with a specific timezone.

Because this scalar depends on the ISO-8601 calendar it is not recommended to
use for dates before the year 1582.
